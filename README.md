### Using git commands
#### Windows
Cloning with the Windows command prompt requires [installing Git](https://git-scm.com/download/)

Once installed, open Cortana's search menu and search cmd. Click to open the command prompt application.

Navigate to the file location where you want to store the application files and enter the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/duncanjd267/Revature_Project3_Shopping_App`

If you don't know how to navigate through directories using the command prompt, refer to this handy guide:

Command       |   Effect
--------------|-----------
`cd <file path>`| Takes you to that filepath on the same drive
`/D <file path>`| Takes you to the filepath on a different drive
`dir`           | Shows directories within current folder

#### Linux and MacOS

Cloning on Unix based machines is a bit simpler. First, open your terminal and navigate to where you want to store the project.
the `cd` command is a commonality with windows, however the `dir` command is replaced with `ls`.

Once you've made it to your chosen directory, enter the same command as the windows section: 

`git clone https://github.com/duncanjd267/Revature_Project3_Shopping_App`
